In this assignment, I am a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. My task is to determine the market price of a house given a set of features. I will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.
